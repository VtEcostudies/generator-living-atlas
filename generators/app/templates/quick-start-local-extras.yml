#
# ssl_certificate_server_dir=/etc/letsencrypt/live/<%= LA_domain %>
# ssl_cert_file=fullchain.pem
# ssl_key_file=privkey.pem
#
# With letsencrypt, is recommended to use one cert with multiple domains to
# make the configuration of the inventories more simple
#
# You can transfer the cert between machines after renewal via hooks (or
# using a shared folder via NFS, etc). See:
