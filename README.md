> An experimal Yeoman Generator for Living Atlas Ansible Inventories

## Intro

This is a simple yeoman generator trying to facilitate a quick start with Living Atlas `ansible` inventories.

So with these generated inventories and [ala-install](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ala-install/) you should deploy a demo with the main LA sercices quickly.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-living-atlas using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

This generator is experimental and it's not published in npm. So if you want to test it, you can clone this repo and:

```bash
npm link
cd /tmp # or other directory
yo living-atlas
```

If we publish this generator in some the future:

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-living-atlas
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo living-atlas
```
